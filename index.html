        <div class="about-me">
            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>I'm Kamal Sacranie and I'm currenly in my second year at LSE doing a BSc Accounting and Finance. I'm extremely passionate about pursuing a career in 
                finance. I'm a driven and dedicated individual and ultimately aim to benefit the greater community that I am part of. I love making personal connections and excel at collaboration and team work.
                I'm used to performing under pressure from my extensive experience of singing and perfoming if front of 
                large audiences. This experience came from the desire to excel in my talents and become the best at performing in my school community, a goal which I acheived. 
                I love to veture out of my comfort zone. Some examples of this would be when I undertook an excursion to EBC (Everest Base Camp) in 2016 
                and when I spent two months in an Indian bording school cia a school exchange. I find that activities that make you uncomfortable manifest into a development 
                of character and provide you with transferrable skills.
                I created this website to show my proficiency in HTML5, CSS and JS.
